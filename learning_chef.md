" Chef is an infrastructure automation and configuration management framework. Simply put, Chef is 'Infrastructure as Code' ". - [opscode.com](https://learnchef.opscode.com/)


This pdf is dedicated to my leanring of chef. I had a difficult time finding a simple "Hello World" example for learning Chef and a even harder time learning by reading the Chef leanrning site. My first break through was with a blog post by [Jonathan Otto](http://jonathanotto.com/blog/chef-tutorial-in-minutes.html). Here he lays out an overview and a way to get working. 

I decided to take this idea and modify it using Vagrant.
